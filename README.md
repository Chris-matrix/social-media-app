## Features Implementation Details

### Creating Posts
- Users can create new posts using the `CreatePost` component.
- Posts are added to the top of the feed.
- Each post includes the author's name, avatar, timestamp, and content.

### Liking Posts
- Users can like posts by clicking the like button.
- The like count updates immediately.
- Multiple likes from the same user are allowed (for simplicity).

### Comments
- Users can add comments to any post.
- Comments display the author's name and comment text.

4. **Comment threading**: Allow nested comments.
5. **Share functionality**: Add share buttons for posts.
6. **Post deletion and editing**: Allow users to delete or edit their posts.
7. **User profiles**: Add user profile pages.
8. **Real-time updates**: Use WebSocket for real-time updates.

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter issues while setting up the project:

1. **Tailwind CSS Configuration**:
   - Ensure `tailwind.config.js` and `postcss.config.js` are correctly configured.
   - Manually create the files if they are not generated:
     ```javascript
     // tailwind.config.js
     export default {
       content: [
         "./index.html",
         "./src/**/*.{js,ts,jsx,tsx}",
       ],
       theme: {
         extend: {},
       },
       plugins: [],
     };
     ```

     ```javascript
     // postcss.config.js
     export default {
       plugins: {
         tailwindcss: {},
         autoprefixer: {},
       },
     };
     ```

2. **Dependency Issues**:
   - Delete `node_modules` and `package-lock.json`, then reinstall dependencies:
     ```bash
     rm -rf node_modules package-lock.json
     npm install
     ```
