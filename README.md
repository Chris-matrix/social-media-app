## Troubleshooting

If you encounter issues while setting up the project:

1. **Tailwind CSS Configuration**:
   - Ensure `tailwind.config.js` and `postcss.config.js` are correctly configured.
   - Manually create the files if they are not generated:
     ```javascript
     // tailwind.config.js
     export default {
       content: [
         "./index.html",
         "./src/**/*.{js,ts,jsx,tsx}",
       ],
       theme: {
         extend: {},
       },
       plugins: [],
     };
     ```

     ```javascript
     // postcss.config.js
     export default {
       plugins: {
         tailwindcss: {},
         autoprefixer: {},
       },
     };
     ```

2. **Dependency Issues**:
   - Delete `node_modules` and `package-lock.json`, then reinstall dependencies:
     ```bash
     rm -rf node_modules package-lock.json
     npm install
     ```
